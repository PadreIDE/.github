# Padre, the Perl IDE

Padre that stands for Perl Application Development and Refactor Environment, is an IDE for Perl written in Perl.

* The main repository of [Padre](Padre)
* The source code of the [Padre](https://padre.perlide.org/) web site is in [this repo](https://github.com/PadreIDE/template.padre.perlide.org/)
* The repo with the [generated web site](https://github.com/PadreIDE/PadreIDE.github.io)

## Tasks

* Setup GitHub Actions for Padre, the web site and all the interesting plugins.
* Release new version of Padre that already points to the correct repository.
* Fix the web site generation. We don't need to store the generated web site any more. We can use GitHub Actions to deploy it.
* Ensure that all the [dependencies of Padres](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/dist/Padre) are well maintained.
